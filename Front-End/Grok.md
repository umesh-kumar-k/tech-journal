### 30-Day Interview Preparation Plan for Senior Frontend Architect (JS, TS, Angular) in Product-Based Companies  
  
This plan is tailored for senior roles at product-based companies (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or startups like Notion or Figma), where interviews emphasize architectural design, scalability, performance, leadership in frontend systems, and deep expertise in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), and Angular. Expect coding challenges, system design discussions, behavioral questions on past architectures, and Angular-specific scenarios like migrating legacy apps or building micro-frontends.  
  
**Key Focus Areas:**  
- **JS/TS:** Core concepts, async handling, type systems for large-scale apps.  
- **Angular:** Architecture, best practices, ecosystem (e.g., NgRx, RxJS), optimization.  
- **Architect Skills:** System design, patterns, security, testing, integrations.  
- **Interview Style:** LeetCode-style coding, frontend system design (e.g., design a dashboard), behavioral (e.g., "Tell me about a time you scaled a frontend app").  
  
**General Tips:**  
- **Daily Routine:** 4-6 hours: 1-2 hours theory/review, 2 hours coding/practice, 1-2 hours mocks/projects.  
- **Resources:** Angular docs ([angular.dev](http://angular.dev/)), TypeScript Handbook, MDN Web Docs, LeetCode (JS/TS problems), "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu (frontend chapters), YouTube (e.g., Angular In Depth conference talks).  
- **Practice Platforms:** LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal for coding; Pramp/Interviewing.io for mocks.  
- **Projects:** Build/refactor apps (e.g., e-commerce dashboard) on GitHub to discuss in interviews.  
- **Mocks:** Start Week 3; record yourself explaining designs.  
- **Track Progress:** Use a journal for notes, weaknesses, and sample answers.  
- **Customize:** Adjust based on your experience; focus on gaps (e.g., if weak in RxJS, prioritize it).
