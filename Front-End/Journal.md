### Choosing the Right Journal Format  
Start by deciding between a physical notebook or a digital tool, based on your preference for portability, searchability, and ease of editing. Physical journals (like a simple lined notebook) are great for quick sketches and mind maps, fostering better retention through handwriting. Digital options, such as Notion, Evernote, OneNote, or Google Docs, allow easy searching, linking, and multimedia integration (e.g., code snippets or images). For technical interview prep, digital is often recommended for its flexibility in organizing complex topics like algorithms or system design.<grok:render card_id="17bdc7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Structuring Your Journal for Organization  
A well-organized journal prevents information overload and makes refreshing easier. Divide it into clear sections to categorize content logically:  
  
- **Topics Section:** Dedicate pages or tabs to core subjects (e.g., Data Structures, Algorithms, System Design, Behavioral Questions). For each topic, include subsections like definitions, key concepts, and real-world examples.  
- **Questions and Answers Section:** Log common interview questions (from LeetCode, Cracking the Coding Interview, or past mocks). Write the question, your initial answer, optimized solutions, and time/space complexity. Use a template: Question > Approach > Code > Edge Cases > Learnings.  
- **Mistakes and Weaknesses Section:** Track errors from practice sessions. Note what went wrong, why, and how to fix it—this aids in targeted refreshing.  
- **Review Log:** A calendar or checklist for tracking review sessions, with dates and quick summaries of what you revisited.  
- **Index or Table of Contents:** At the front, create an index for quick navigation. In digital tools, use tags or hyperlinks.  
  
Prepare a standard template before starting to streamline note-taking and reduce decision-making during prep.<grok:render card_id="7a2d01" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Effective Note-Taking Techniques  
Focus on techniques that promote active recall and concise documentation, rather than verbatim copying:  
  
- **Cornell Method:** Divide each page into three parts: Notes (main content), Cues (keywords/questions on the left), and Summary (bottom for quick recaps). This is ideal for technical topics, as cues help with self-quizzing during refresh sessions.  
- **Mind Mapping:** For interconnected topics (e.g., how sorting algorithms relate), draw visual diagrams with branches for pros/cons, use cases, and code examples. Tools like XMind or paper work well.  
- **Keywords and Bullet Points:** Prioritize brevity—use keywords, abbreviations, and highlights instead of full sentences. Capture verbatims from resources (e.g., exact Big O notations) and include your own examples or code snippets.<grok:render card_id="d6a173" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">  
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>  
</grok:render> For behavioral answers, jot STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) frameworks.  
- **Flashcard Integration:** Turn notes into flashcards (physical or via Anki app) for spaced repetition. Note one concept per card, with questions on front and answers on back.  
- **Active Annotation:** While studying, annotate with questions like "Why does this work?" or "Common pitfalls?" to encourage deeper understanding.
